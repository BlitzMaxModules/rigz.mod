	about: This module provides a base entity class for use in any applications that need to have objects in world that need to be controlled
	and drawn onto the screen. tlEntity provides the means to control these objects in a structured hierarchy with parent and child entities.
	Entities are drawn using sprites from the single surface module; singlesurface.mod.

	bbdoc: Entity type for basic object information
	about: <p>This is the main type for storing entity information such as coordinates, colour and other information. This type is designed to be a base
	type that you can use to extend and create other types, for example tPlayer or tBullet. </p>
	<p>Entities can be parented to other entities and maintain and update a list of children. These children can be relative to their parents therefore
	minimising the work needed to calculate where entities should be drawn to the screen. If a parent rotates, then it's children will rotate with it and
	likewise, if the parent moves then its children will move with it as well. Children don't have to be relative however, set realative to false using #setrelative
	to make the children move independantly, however they will still be updated by their parent</p>
	<p>If you have an entity with children, and those children in turn have children, in order to update all of those entities only one call to the parent
	#update method is required to see all of the children updated too. This also applies to rendering the entities on screen - by calling #render on the parent entity
	all children entities will also be rendered. See the code below for an example</p>
	<p>Entities draw to the screen using tAnimImage, a type that allows for single surface drawing from the singlesurface.mod. To set the image use #setavatar
	and loadsprite() to set the tAnimImage. You can adjust the appearence of the entity such as colour and scale using commands such as #setentitycolor, #setentityalpha,
	#setentityscale and #setangle</p>
	<p>When entities are rendered they can be tweened so that their animation and movement on the screen is smoothed out using fixed rate timing. To do this you need to make a call
	to #capture each time the entity is updated which stores the entities last position and other details. #Capture is not included in the #udpate method because it makes things
	too inflexible. There are situations where you might want to specify when exactly you want to #capture the entity. This means that when you extend tlentity it's a good idea to 
	overide the update method with your own and include a call to capture within it. Then you can make a call to super.update so that the base update method is still tun. Again, see 
	the example to see how it can work.</p>

		about: Tweening is used in applications that use fixed rate timing. This is where the logic routines of an application are updated a fixed
		amount of times each frame, but the drawing routines are updated as many times as possible. Each time the entity is updated during a logic
		update you can capture its coordinates, then, depending on how much time has passed since the last logic update, the entity can be interpolated
		between the old coordinates and the new ones creating a nice smooth movement no matter the PC you're running it on. To simplify things you
		can use the tweener.mod to implement fixed rate timing. See the tweener.mod for more info.
