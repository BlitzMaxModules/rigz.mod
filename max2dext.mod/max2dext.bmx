bbdoc: Extended Max2D
about: <p>Max2D module provides a few extra features for the standard max2d, mainly the loading of images in PreMultipliedAlpha mode which enables 
		and additional blend mode - screen blend, plus making it a lot easier to grab a screen with the lpaha channel intact.</p>
		<p>In order to use this properly for your own use (this is mainly for use internally by timelinefx you need to follow a few rules:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Use #SetGraphicsDriverEXT and set the driver to the specific max2d driver you're using, ie., GLMax2DDriverEXT(),D3D7Max2DDriverEXT() or
		D3D9Max2DDriverEXT()</li>
		<li>After setting that make sure you call InitEXTGraphics() to initialise the extended driver.</li>
		<li>For all images you load with #LoadImageEXT or #LoadAnimImageEXT with the PreMultiAlpha falg set to true, you need to use the following
		max2d state change commands instead of the normal ones: #SetBlendEXT, #SetColorEXT and #SetAlphaEXT.</li>
		<li>If you want to switch between SetBlend for a normal image (non-premultiplied alpha) and SetBlendEXT then you need to use #ResetBlendMode after
		calling #SetBlendEXT and ResetBlendModeEXT after using the normal SetBlend. This is only necessary when you switch bettwen the two, so if you used 
		#SetBlendEXT 10 times in a row you' only have to use ResetBlendMode after the 10th one befoer using the normal SetBlend command.</li>
		<li></li>
		</ol>

bbdoc: Set current blend mode
about: 
SetBlend controls how pixels are combined with existing pixels in the back buffer when drawing
commands are used in BlitzMax.

@blend should be one of:

[ @{Blend mode} | @Effect
* MASKBLEND | Pixels are drawn only if their alpha component is greater than .5
* SOLIDBLEND | Pixels overwrite existing backbuffer pixels
* ALPHABLEND | Pixels are alpha blended with existing backbuffer pixels
* LIGHTBLEND | Pixel colors are added to backbuffer pixel colors, giving a 'lighting' effect
* SCREENBLEND | Blends the colours similar to the photoshop screen blend
* SHADEBLEND | Pixel colors are multiplied with backbuffer pixel colors, giving a 'shading' effect

The range from 0.0 to 1.0 allows a range of transparancy from completely transparent 
to completely solid.
