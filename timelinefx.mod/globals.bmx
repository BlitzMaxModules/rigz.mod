rem

	about: Default is 1 time per second. This means that the lookup tables for attribute nodes will be accurate to 1 millisecond which is as accuarte as it can be. Higher
	values will save memory but effect will judder more and be less accurate the higher you go. The memory foot print is very small so 1 should be fine for 99% of apps.
